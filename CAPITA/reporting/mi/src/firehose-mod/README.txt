# firehose-mod

This lambda requires a more recent version of boto3 than that
included in the AWS lambda container.

Install dependencies before deploying to AWS using the following command

```bash
# in code/ directory:
pip install -r requirements.txt -t .
```

Alternatively, you can try:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t .
```
