# CAPITA-CONNECT

This repo is divided into two directories: 'KCOM' for KCOM-internal material that should not be shared with external parties and 'CAPITA' for
CAPITA-specific material that is intended to be shared.

The CAPITA directory is further split into the following projects:

1. New Customer Baseline - a basic set up for any new *customer* account
2. Reporting:
  * RTA Reporting - real-time adherance for call-centre agents
  * MI Reporting - business intelligence reporting
  * Dashboard - agent and queue metric scripts (client-side only)
3. Active Directory - integration with ADFS

Each project contains it's own README.md that details how each solution is deployed.
